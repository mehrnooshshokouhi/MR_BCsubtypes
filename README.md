This repository includes the codes used to perform analyses for the mentioned study.   
# Part 1: Rscripts
1. MR_LDlink.R
   The aim of this Rscript is to identify BCAC proxies for MR analyses.
   For SNPs that were not available in the BCAC GWAS summary statistics, we searched for proxy SNPs (linkage disequilibrium r2 â‰¥ 0.8) using the NIH LDlink API implemented in the LDlinkR R-package.
